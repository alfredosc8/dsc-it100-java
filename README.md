#DSC IT-100 Java Library

##Introduction

This library exposes all the capabilities of the DSC PowerSeries Integration Module as a Java API. With it, you should be able to automate security system tasks and receive notifications of events.

The library is very much a work in progress. It is built using Apache MINA, a library for implementing protocols. The first pass of the API is nearly complete, and usable as is. The most common IT-100 commands and messages are implemented. The less common ones still need implemented. Expect a major refactoring of the base API in the near future.
